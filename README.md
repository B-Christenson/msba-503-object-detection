# MSBA 503 Object Detection Assignment
This repository contains the completed take-home assignment for MSBA 503: Analytics Programming II. The objective of this assignment is to apply image analysis and object detection techniques using Python and evaluate model results.

## Repository Contents
	| File | Description |
	|------|-------------|
	| object_detection.ipynb | Main Jupyter Notebook containing code, visualizations, 	and written responses. |
	| object_detection_results.csv | Output file summarizing detected objects and 	confidence scores. |
	| Images/ | Directory containing input images used for object detection. |
	| .gitignore | Specifies files excluded from version control. |

## Assignment Objectives
	• Load and explore the provided images  
	• Apply a pre-trained object detection model  
	• Document detection results and evaluate accuracy  
	• Organize and communicate findings in a clear analytical format

## Methods and Tools
	• Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
	• Computer vision and object detection libraries (as instructed in course material)  
	• CSV file export to summarize detection results

## Results Summary
	The object detection workflow successfully completed on the provided image set.  
	Detected objects and confidence values are included in 	`object_detection_results.csv`.  
	Example outputs are shown within the notebook.
